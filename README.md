# P2P-is-COOP
**P2P software/Network is the equivalent of COOPERATIVES, for bits!**  
  
P2P software and COOPERATIVE organizations not only share things in common, both are distinct elements of the same idea.  
  
Making both work together can advance each one to high levels that none will be able to achieve if they only work at the level they are today, distinct and separated from each other.

In fact, I believe that **THE WAY** to move both forward is by promoting the mix/blending/fusion of these 2 subjects together!  
  
I believe that there are things that are possible today and easy to achieve, that will work as tools, to basically, power-up further development in both, P2P and Cooperativism...

I am trying to build a coherent text about this subject here... for now, there is a PDF and respective slides inside the "doc" directory...
